## Release v0.0.3

### 💫 Highlights
* Finally succeeded in building the docs!

### 📖 Documentation

* Added `make build-docs` to execute and overwrite .ipynb to use in docs, since `PyGMT` can't be included in dependencies and therefore RTD's can't execute the .ipynb's.

### ⛔ Maintenance

* Closed [Issue #7](https://github.com/mdtanker/antarctic_plots/issues/7)

## Release v0.0.2

### 💫 Highlights
* Created a [website for the documentation!](https://antarctic-plots.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#)

* Added `NumPy` formatted docstrings to the modules

* Wrote contribution guide, which outlines the unique case of publishing a package with dependencies which need C packages, like `PyGMT` (`GMT`) and `GeoPandas` (`GDAL`).

* Added `Tips` for generating shapefiles and picking start/end points

### 📖 Documentation

* Re-wrote docstrings to follow `NumPy` format.
* Added type-hints to docstrings.

### ⛔ Maintenance

* Closed [Issue #13](https://github.com/mdtanker/antarctic_plots/issues/13)
* Closed [Issue #9](https://github.com/mdtanker/antarctic_plots/issues/9)
* Closed [Issue #2](https://github.com/mdtanker/antarctic_plots/issues/2)

## Release v0.0.1

### 💫 Highlights
* also probably should have been published to TestPyPI 🤦♂️

### 🚀 Features

* Added a Makefile for streamlining development, publishing, and doc building.
* Added license notifications to all files.


### 📖 Documentation

* Used `Jupyter-Book` structure, with a table of contents (_toc.yml) and various markdown files.
* added `Sphinx.autodoc` to automatically include API documentation.


### ⛔ Maintenance

* Looks of issues with the Poetry -> Jupyter-Books -> Read the Docs workflow
* Poetry / RTD don't like `PyGMT` or `GeoPandas` since they both rely on C packages which can't be installed via pip (`GMT` and `GDAL`). Next release should fix this.
